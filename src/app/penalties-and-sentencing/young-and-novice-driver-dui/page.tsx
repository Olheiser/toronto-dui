                    <p>If you&apos;re a young or novice driver in Ontario, any amount of alcohol or drugs in your system when driving can have serious consequences. Under Ontario&apos;s zero-tolerance policy, drivers aged 21 and under, or those holding a G1, G2, M1, or M2 licence, are prohibited from having any alcohol or drugs in their system while operating a vehicle.</p>

                    <p>This zero-tolerance rule reflects the increased risk that impaired driving presents to the driver, passengers, and everyone else on the road.</p>

                    <h2>What Constitutes an Offence?</h2>
                    <p className={styles.contentBreak}>Driving under the influence doesn&apos;t just mean having a high blood alcohol concentration (BAC); as a young or novice driver, even trace amounts of alcohol or drugs could lead to charges. Impairment can also come from prescription medications or over-the-counter drugs that affect your ability to drive. You&apos;ll face immediate penalties if a police officer detects any level of impairment or substances in your system.</p>
