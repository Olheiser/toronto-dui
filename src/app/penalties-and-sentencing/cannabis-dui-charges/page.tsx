                    <p className={styles.contentBreak}>Driving while impaired by cannabis is illegal and carries serious penalties in Ontario. Whether the cannabis is consumed legally or not, operating a vehicle under its influence endangers public safety and can result in significant legal consequences. This applies to all types of vehicles, including cars, boats, and off-road vehicles.</p>

                    <h2>What is Cannabis-Impaired Driving?</h2>
                    <p>Cannabis impairs your driving ability by affecting reaction time, coordination, and decision-making skills. In Ontario, if your ability to drive is compromised due to cannabis use, you can be charged with impaired driving, regardless of the amount consumed. Additionally, Ontario enforces zero-tolerance policies for specific drivers, such as young and novice drivers, who cannot have any detectable cannabis in their system.</p>

                    <h2>Penalties for Cannabis-Impaired Driving Under the Criminal Code of Canada</h2>
                    <p>In addition to Ontario&apos;s penalties, federal laws under the Criminal Code of Canada set prohibited levels for THC in the blood and specify the following penalties:</p>
                    
                    <h3>Prohibited THC Levels:</h3>
                    <ul className={`${styles.contentList}`}>
                        <li><strong>2 to 5 nanograms (ng) of THC per millilitre (ml) of blood:</strong> Summary conviction with a maximum $1,000 fine.</li>
                        <li><strong>5 ng or more of THC per ml of blood:</strong> Offence carries stiffer penalties, similar to alcohol-impaired driving.</li>
                        <li><strong>Combination of 50 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood and 2.5 ng or more of THC per ml of blood:</strong> Considered a serious offence with escalating penalties.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Penalties for Drug-Impaired Driving:</h3>
                    <ul className={`${styles.contentList}`}>
                        <li><strong>1st DUI:</strong> Minimum $1,000 fine.</li>
                        <li><strong>2nd DUI:</strong> Minimum 30 days in jail.</li>
                        <li><strong>3rd DUI:</strong> Minimum 120 days in jail, with a maximum penalty of 10 years.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Convictions for drug-impaired driving at the federal level can lead to severe outcomes, including up to 14 years imprisonment if the offence results in bodily harm, or a life sentence if it causes death.</p>

                    <h2>Detection of Cannabis Impairment</h2>
                    
                    <p><strong>Oral Fluid Drug Screeners:</strong></p>
                    <p>Police officers may use roadside oral fluid tests to detect THC. These tests are quick and accurate, confirming the presence of cannabis in the system. A positive result, combined with signs of impairment, can lead to further testing, such as a blood sample.</p>

                    <p><strong>Standard Field Sobriety Tests (SFSTs) and Drug Recognition Expert (DRE) Evaluations</strong></p>
                    <p className={styles.contentBreak}>If impairment is suspected, officers may require drivers to complete a sobriety test or undergo a DRE evaluation. Refusal to comply can lead to additional charges and penalties.</p>
