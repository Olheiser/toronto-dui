                    <p className={styles.contentBreak}>If you&apos;ve been convicted of a DUI in Ontario, one of the most immediate and lasting impacts is the suspension of your driver&apos;s licence. The reinstatement process involves several steps, fees, and potentially mandatory programs.</p>

                    <h2>Types of Suspensions After a DUI</h2>
                    <p>In Ontario, a DUI conviction typically leads to two types of licence suspensions:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Administrative Licence Suspension:</strong> This occurs immediately upon arrest for a DUI-related offence, as mandated by the Highway Traffic Act. After a 90-day suspension period, you may reinstate your licence by paying a reinstatement fee.</li>
                        <li><strong>Court-Ordered Suspension:</strong> Following a conviction, the court imposes another suspension. This suspension&apos;s length varies based on the number of offences and requires additional steps to reinstate.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p className={styles.contentBreak}>Don&apos;t navigate the reinstatement process alone. Call <a href="tel:6476972876">(647) 697-2876</a> today for a free consultation with an experienced impaired driving lawyer.</p>

                    <h2>Steps to Reinstate Your Driver&apos;s Licence</h2>
                    <p className={styles.contentH3Break}>The following steps are essential to regain your driving privileges after serving your suspension period:</p>
                    <h3>Pay Outstanding Fines</h3>
                    <p className={styles.contentH3Break}>Pay any fines related to your DUI conviction.</p>
                    <h3>Complete Court-Ordered Programs</h3>
                    <ul className={`${styles.contentH3Break} ${styles.contentList}`}>
                        <li><strong>Back on Track Program:</strong> This mandatory program focuses on education and treatment regarding impaired driving.</li>
                        <li><strong>Ignition Interlock Program:</strong> Once eligible for reinstatement, your licence will include an ignition interlock designation, meaning you can only drive vehicles equipped with an ignition interlock system. This requirement lasts:
                            <ul>
                                <li>One year for a first offence</li>
                                <li>Three years for a second offence</li>
                                <li>Six years for a third offence following a 10-year suspension</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Gather Documentation:</h3> 
                    <p className={styles.contentH3Break}>After completing all court-ordered programs, collect any documents, like a Notice of Suspension letter or other court-issued records, proving that your suspension has been lifted.</p>
                    <h3>Pay Reinstatement Fee:</h3> 
                    <p className={styles.contentH3Break}>Bring your documents to a ServiceOntario center and pay the $281 reinstatement fee. Ensure any fines related to your DUI conviction are settled, as this fee is required to process your reinstatement.</p>
                    <h3>Complete Testing Requirements:</h3> 
                    <p>Based on the length of your suspension, you may need to fulfill additional testing:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>1-3 years:</strong> Vision test.</li>
                            <li><strong>3-10 years:</strong> Vision test, written knowledge test, and two road tests (G1 and G2).</li>
                            <li><strong>10+ years:</strong> Reapply as a new driver, completing all graduated licensing tests.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <h2>Understanding the Back on Track Program</h2>
                    <p>The Back on Track Program is Ontario&apos;s mandatory Remedial Measures Program for drivers convicted of impaired driving or who have two or more administrative suspensions. It includes three main components:</p>
                    <ul className={`${styles.contentBreak} ${styles.contentList}`}>
                        <li><strong>Assessment:</strong> Determines whether you&apos;ll attend an 8-hour educational workshop or a 16-hour treatment workshop.</li>
                        <li><strong>Workshop:</strong> Depending on the assessment outcome, participants will attend either:
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>8-hour Education Workshop:</strong> Focuses on myths and facts about alcohol and drugs, their effects on driving, legal consequences, and strategies to avoid impaired driving.</li>
                                <li><strong>16-hour Treatment Workshop:</strong> For higher-risk participants, this in-depth workshop covers reasons for substance use, its impact on life, and strategies to manage triggers and stress.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Follow-Up Interview:</strong> A six-month follow-up ensures participants have absorbed the program&apos;s lessons.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Participating in the Ignition Interlock Program</h2>
                    <p className={styles.contentBreak}>The ignition interlock system is a breathalyzer device installed in your vehicle. It prevents your car from starting if it detects any alcohol over a pre-set limit. This program includes periodic, random breath tests while driving to ensure you&apos;re not consuming alcohol behind the wheel. Your suspension may be extended if you fail to comply with the interlock requirements.</p>
